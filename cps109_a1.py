'''For my CPS109 assignment, I wish to make a program which analyze userâ€™s 
input to help him solve a choice problem between 4 types of reinforcement 
in psychology, which I learned that in PSY107 this semester. 
After identified the reinforcement type he needs, 
my program will provide an example 
and generate a txt output if user wants it.'''
